# HDG3D
This is a Matlab implementation of the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin method on general tetrahedrizations of polyhedra in three dimensional space. The code includes tools to solve variable diffusion and convection-diffusion equations. The code was developed by the numerical group Team Pancho at the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Delaware. The code is fully documented, not too tough to use, and quite easy to modify if you take your time to learn how degrees of freedom are counted and what's the general idea of HDG. In the near future, we'll add some worked out examples and more capabilities that are being developed.

## Developers
Following is the list of developers with affiliations at the time of the release of the first version of this code.
* Francisco-Javier Sayas, University of Delaware (Coordinator)
* Zhixing (Jason) Fu (2011 - 2013) - Coding HDG3D was part of Zhixing's doctoral work.
* Luis F. Gatica (2012) Catholic University of Concepcion, Chile - The first version of the code was developed while Luis Gatica was visiting UD.
* Allan Hungria, University of Delaware
* Daniele Prada, Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis

## Software and documentation
* [Latest HDG3D package](https://github.com/team-pancho/HDG3D/releases) (This contains a library of Matlab functions. The file contains also one fully developed script to test the method and a couple of three dimensional meshes. No installation is required.)
* [Documentation](https://github.com/team-pancho/HDG3D/tree/master/Documentation) (A pdf file with the full documentation of the method)
* [A copy of a slightly earlier version of the code in the ACM repository](http://calgo.acm.org/949.zip). The [ACM TOMS paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2658992) explaining how HDG3D is coded.
